[SOFTWARE TODO?]

It is important to remember that the release of the data in 2014 came four years after these data were collected. Roles within the collaboration change regularly and those responsible for various data-collection efforts in 2010 were not necessarily involved in those activities come 2014. Therefore, significant efforts were made to acquire the relevant documentation and preserve the institutional knowledge of the collaboration.
