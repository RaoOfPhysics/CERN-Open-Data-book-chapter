## Software environment and documentation

[SOFTWARE TODO?]
Even in a "reconstructed" format including meaningful objects reconstructed from raw data, the data of the LHC experiments still remain very complex. The data files cannot be opened and understood as simple data tables, but they contain special structures with all necessary information for data interpretation, and dedicated software is necessary to analyse them. The software and an appropriate working environment must be provided together with an open data release. Using these data for scientific purposes requires good knowledge of experimental particle physics and functioning of a detector, and documentation can hardly cover all these aspects, understanding of which is usually acquired during undergraduate and graduate studies. 

It is important to remember that the release of the data happens some years after these data were collected. Roles within the collaboration change regularly and those responsible for various data-collection efforts at the time of adta-taking are not necessarily involved in those activities come data release. Therefore, significant efforts are needed to acquire and capture the relevant documentation and preserve the institutional knowledge of the collaboration.
