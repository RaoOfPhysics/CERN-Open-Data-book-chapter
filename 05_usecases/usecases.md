# Use cases

The division of the CERN Open Data Portal into two top-level sections -- Education and Research -- reflects the two main anticipated use-cases. The division also reflects the respective levels of physics and software knowledge needed to use the content in each section. Primary datasets from the LHC detectors found under Research reflect the complexity of the detectors themselves. To be able to extract something meaningful from these datasets one needs at least: knowledge of the physics involved, familiarity with the data format, knowledge of the detector and its performance, a software environment and API specific to the experiment, and software expertise. These are significant hurdles for the general public. The material found in Education, on the other hand, has already found use by the general public in many cases and is more easily accessible.
