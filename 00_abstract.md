This chapter covers perspectives from the various partners who have worked on the release of large volumes of open research data from the Large Hadron Collider via the CERN Open Data Portal. The early experiences mentioned in the title refer to the launch of the Portal in November 2014 with the release of the first batch of high-level research data collected by the CMS Collaboration in 2010. The chapter covers the motivation for releasing particle-physics data openly as well as the challenges faced and solutions provided to do so. The authors also touch upon the use cases of the open datasets and the impact the first release has had.
