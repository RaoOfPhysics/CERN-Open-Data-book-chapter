## Software environment and documentation

Even in a format that includes meaningful objects reconstructed from raw data, the data from the LHC still remain very complex. The data files cannot be opened and understood as simple data tables -- they contain special structures with all the necessary information for data interpretation -- and dedicated software is necessary to analyse them. The software and an appropriate working environment must be provided together with the open data. Using these data for scientific purposes requires good knowledge of experimental particle physics and functioning of a detector, and documentation can hardly cover all these aspects, understanding of which is usually acquired during undergraduate and graduate studies.

It is also important to remember that the release of the data happens some years after these data were collected. Roles within the collaboration change regularly and those responsible for various data-collection efforts at the time of data-taking are not necessarily involved in those activities come data release. Therefore, significant efforts are needed to acquire and capture the relevant documentation and preserve the institutional knowledge of the collaboration.
