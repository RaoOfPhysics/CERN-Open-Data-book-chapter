Impact on scientists

When the CMS collaboration first drafted the Open Access policy in 2012, the concept was totally new in High Energy Physics. Several concerns were expressed within the collaboration, mainly addressing the eventual additional workload to the collaboration members in case someone would claim contradictory or false results based on the open data. The very concept of open data was new: the researchers - correctly - see the published result as the goal of the research work, and publishing data without results may have been seen as unnecessary, premature or meaningless.

However, it was considered that the benefits of the open data, in terms of preserving their scientific potential and enabling their use in education, widely overcome the potential risks. Indeed, the first data release in 2014 gave overwhelmingly positive feedback and the CMS collaboration has now accepted the concept of further regular data releases.

The core of the public CMS data are in the same format as used internally for data analysis. There is no simplification or curation of these data particularly for public release, they are part of the legacy data, which are reprocessed with a single software version for a longer period of data-taking (e.g. one version for 2010 data and another versions for the 2011-2012). This was considered only viable solution for releasing substantial amount of scientific data, as in this case no time and resource consuming additional validation for public data is needed. Furthermore, the exact provenance details (software versions, configuration parameters) can be directly extracted from the CMS internal data description systems.

Making data public does not make them any simpler. Finding human resources to provide adequate instructions and documentation is a concern for a collaboration in active data-taking phase, with all resources focused on collecting and analysing new data. The experience of the first data release was instructive: even if the preparations for the data to be released were started with a fairly short delay after the last reprocessing of these data and considering that some of the last publications on these data were done just a bit earlier, finding the correct set of instructions and documentation was not an easy task for many simple reasons. The people in charge have moved to different positions, the documentation have been updated and finding the correct set of instructions corresponding to the exact software release is not as obvious as as it may seem. Having learnt from this, CMS is now already collecting the instructions for the data to be released in the future.
