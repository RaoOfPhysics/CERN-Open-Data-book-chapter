A collaborative approach was taken to deliver the CERN Open Data Portal and the big first open data release for CMS at the same time. Together with CMS, members of CERN IT and CERN Scientific Information service developed the platform, its visualization tools, the data and software (access) for the release, as well as user guidance and documentation. From the very beginning, it proofed to be important to have subject specialists, information specialists and information technology experts together on board to tackle the delivery of big complex datasets. 
The platform is based on the digital library framework Invenio [link] which originates from CERN as well. Using this digital library platforms provides users with sophisticated search technology while preservation standards are ensured and preservation practices facilitated. Invenio workflows adhere to OAIS. 
On the CERN Open Data Portal each data set has its own record. Related records are aggregated in dedicated collections, e.g. for primary or derived data. Within each record, metadata is provided. Metadata is standardised according MARC [link]. Inspired by the practices developed for the related informaton platforms in HEP (e.g. INSPIRE and CDS), standard metadata fields were populated and additional metadata fields needed to be created to make sure information about data are comprehensive. The information provided was "tested" to be comprehensive enough for future reuse of the provided data. 
An example data record for primary data is shown below (Fig x for basic metadata and y for more specific information).
