The Large Hadron Collider is the biggest, most powerful particle accelerator ever built. Four giant particle detectors, operated by international crews of scientists and engineers, record data from collisions inside the accelerator. These collisions generate an enormous volume of data for analysis &mdash; of the order of petabytes over just a few years of operation. In order to ensure that the data are available for future researchers, the four big LHC collaborations have put in place data-preservation policies, which include, of course, making the data and analysis software open.

CERN, the host laboratory for the LHC collaborations, is itself a strong proponent of openness, having ensured that all particle-physics results from these collaborations are published via open-access papers. In addition, CERN has helped build tools such as Invenio and ZENODO, which have helped thousands of scientists archive their work via meaningful and persistent identifiers.

Leveraging off CERN IT's experience with digital libraries, we have built the CERN Open Data Portal to store and provide users with access to open data from the LHC collaborations. In the spirit of openness, development work for the Portal is also conducted in the open, via GitHub.
