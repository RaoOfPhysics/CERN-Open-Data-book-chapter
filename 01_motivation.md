The Large Hadron Collider is the biggest, most powerful particle accelerator ever built. Four giant particle detectors, operated by international crews of scientists and engineers, record data from collisions inside the accelerator. These collisions generate an enormous volume of data for analysis â€” of the order of petabytes over just a few years of operation. In order to ensure that the data are available for future researchers, the four big LHC collaborations have put in place data preservation and access policies. These lay out basic statements on preservation and data publishing, i.e. embargo periods, openness, licensing and reuse. The specifications distinguish four different data levels (based on DPHEP, 2009) that define the resulting recommendations. 

CERN, the host laboratory for the LHC collaborations, is itself a strong proponent of openness, having ensured that all particle-physics results from these collaborations are published via open-access papers [reference scoap3 and cern open access policy here]. More recently this paradigm has been expanded to cover Open Science more comprehensively. As part of this we have built the CERN Open Data Portal to store and provide users with access to open data from the LHC collaborations.

Overall CERN has helped build tools and digital libraries to foster Open Science practices beyond the particle physics community. Leveraging off CERN's experience with digital libraries (i.e. Invenio digital library software)for example ZENODO has been built, which have helped thousands of scientists archive their work via meaningful and persistent identifiers. 

In the spirit of openness, development work for the portal is also conducted in the open, via GitHub.
