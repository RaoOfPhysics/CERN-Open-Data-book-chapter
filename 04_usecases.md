Primary datasets from the LHC experiments reflect the complexity of the experiments themselves. To be able to extract anything meaningful from these datasets one needs at least: knowledge of the physics involved, familiarity with the data format, knowledge of the detector and its performance, a software environment and API particular to the experiment, and software expertise. These are significant hurdles for the general public.

Derived datasets are reductions of the primary datasets in the sense that only part of the information in the primary datasets is kept and/or only some of the events in the primary datasets are selected. Very often the derived datasets are produced in open, human-readable formats such as CSV, XML, and JSON; this is only possible when some of the information from the primary datastes is kept. 

The actual content and level of complexity of a particular derived dataset often depends on the intended audience. Open data as distributed in derived datasets find widest use in so-called masterclasses. Here, the intended audience are students at the high-school level. The purpose of the masterclass is to teach students a bit about particle physics, the experiments and detectors used to study it, and to give a sense of what it is like to analyse data and to obtain a result. The masterclass often takes place at a local university or laboratory.

A dataset used in a masterclass is prepared by a physicist with a specific analysis in mind. For example, both ATLAS and CMS have masterclasses where the students are meant to estimate the ratio of positively-charge W bosons to that of negatively-charged W bosons. Therefore, a sample of W bosons must be extracted from the primary datasets. These datasets are distributed as either CSV or XML files. 

A typical masterclass day starts with a short lecture on particle physics, how the detector works, and how to conduct the analysis to follow. The students view up to one hundred events in an interactive event display: an application that visually renders the events and detector. [screen shot?] With the display the students attempt to determine whether or not the event displayed a W+ and a W-. Very often several groups around the world [need to mention IPPOG and QuarkNet somewhere] are participating in the same masterclasses and student can then compare results via a video conference. 

The material available as educational content in the open data portal includes: derived datasets prepared for specific educational exercises such as masterclasses and tutorials and for applications such as event displays, example analysis code, and virtual machine environment with experiment software. Also included are links to further documentation and information.
