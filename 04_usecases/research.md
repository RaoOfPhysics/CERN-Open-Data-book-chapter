## Research

Open access to the data will, in the long term, allow the maximum realization of their scientific potential. The potential users are collaboration members long after the data are taken, or experimental and theoretical HEP scientists who were not members of the collaboration. Furthermore, these data can be of use in other domains, interest to CMS open data has been expressed from areas such as machine learning and development of statistical methods.

To facilitate the data use, technical information about the physics objects in data were collected, together with the important points to understand and keep in mind in analyses. The re-usability of the data in research has furthermore been tested with high-level validation benchmark analyses for primary datasets in the release. These validation benchmarks reproduce published analyses with not too complicated but nevertheless interesting physics contents, which are feasible with the available data and offer possibility for comparison (later) with data at other beam energies. All steps in these benchmarks are doable with the tools and information available publicly, and if information is lacking to complete the process, it will be made avalaibale on the portal. As a first example, the validation record \footnote{\url{http://opendata.cern.ch/record/560}} reproduces a spectrum covering a wide mass range of invariant mass computed from two muons and showing different resonances published in  \footnote{\url{http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-0221/7/10/P10002}}.
