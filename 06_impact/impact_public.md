## Impact on general public

The launch of the CERN Open Data Portal in November 2014 along with the publication of the CMS primary datasets (27 TB), derived datasets, interactive event visualiser, the CMS virtual machines and the analysis software examples was met with considerable interest from the general public.

The launch was covered by major news networks and on social media, with many articles inviting readers to run an LHC physics analysis "in your living room". In the month following the release, more than 80,000 people visited the Portal, which is several times larger than the active particle-physics community (estimated at around 20,000). Most of the visitors spent time browsing around the site and using the provided interactive tools. Several thousands of visitors explored the provided data by downloading the virtual machines and software to study the datasets.

Two weeks after the launch of the Portal, an "Ask Me Anything" session was organised on Reddit\footnote{\url{https://redd.it/2nxwkb}}, where readers could ask questions about open data and open-science practices at CERN. The Reddit AMA session attracted considerable attention and led to another peak in visitors to the CERN Open Data Portal.

The public interest in the released open data generated some non-physics use case scenarios, such as using the large datasets as a robust input for digital forensics studies related to security in cloud computing. It is enlightening to see possible applications outside of the primary focus of the data, which is physics analysis.
